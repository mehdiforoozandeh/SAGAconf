# Legacy

This directory contains codes that have been developed throughout the research but are not used anymore anywhere in the 
pipeline. These include scripts for converting BAM files to fold change, running batch jobs, checking BED files for 
reproducibility, concatenating runs, debugging Segway, generating mnemonics, performing pseudoreplication, and analyzing signal 
distribution.
